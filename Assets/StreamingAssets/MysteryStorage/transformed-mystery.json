    "context": "Victoria Blackwood was found DEAD in the lounge room bathroom! The Montreu Fashion Week has just wrapped up, and Blackwood, the infamous owner and editor of the prestigious legacy fashion magazine Couture En Mass, along with several other big names in the art and fashion industry of Meidell, embarked on the secretive #MRT line, leaving Station No. 5 in Montreu and on their way back to Meidell where they operate. But, now she's hanging by her neck from the industrial tubes passing through the ceiling of the small cublicle, the sink still running. With her magazine's declining popularity among the youth, her suicide appears particularly timely. But with Victoria picking up fights across the entire industry, foul play is NOT out of the question..."
